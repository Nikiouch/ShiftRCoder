# ShiftRCoder
PHP scripts which demonstrate work of the pseudo random generator with shift register
The encode.php endodes file text.txt by bit xor operation with random sequence. Random sequence generates with shift register^ register length is 32 bits. Also, this script tests the endcoded file with NIST stack of tests. 
Output: 
text_decoded1.txt - encoded file
text_encoded.txt - encoded bin file
text_decoded2.txt - decoded file
text_decoded.txt - decoded bin file
key.txt - key sequence for shift register, initial state
